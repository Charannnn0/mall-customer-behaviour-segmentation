# Mall Customer Behavior Segmentation

This Python-based project segments mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. Using K-Means clustering, it identifies key customer segments, helping businesses better understand and target their audience.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and preprocessed customer data to ensure high-quality inputs.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized and analyzed customer attributes like age, annual income, and spending score.
- **Clustering Model**: Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers, revealing meaningful groups that share similar characteristics.
- **Results Visualization**: Plotted clusters for easy interpretability, providing clear insights into different customer types.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** for data manipulation and modeling
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Scikit-Learn** for clustering algorithms
- **streamlit** build and share machine learning and data science web apps

## Use Cases
This segmentation helps in creating targeted marketing campaigns, improving customer engagement, and personalizing shopping experiences based on customer preferences.
